## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project helped me get more comfortable with grid display, and wasn't too complicated coming off of the last two grid projects. The big thing I took away from this project was to double check my grid width and height so I don't have anything spilling over into the other grid sections. I spent a bit too long trying to figure out I just didn't add my lengths correctly.
